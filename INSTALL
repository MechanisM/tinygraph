Thanks for downloading TinyGraph.

Installation is not yet possible. This feature will be added when the product
is in a stable version.

Requirements:

The following python modules are dependencies and can be installed by running:

    * Django==1.2.3

In addition TinyGraph requires the non-python net-snmp C library to be
installed an compiled with python bindings.
