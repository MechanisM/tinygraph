TinyGraph
=========

TinyGraph is born out of the frustration of using other network monitoring
tools, and sets forth with the vision that monitoring your devices shouldn't
require an encyclopaedic knowledge of the underlying protocols.

It abstracts away from complicated configuration, allowing new users an easy
access point into the SNMP based monitoring world.

Polling each defined device around every 5 minutes, TinyGraph collects a pool
of data with which it builds visualisations of your devices and there 
resources. Over time you can spot trends or problems with machines, or plan
upgrades.
